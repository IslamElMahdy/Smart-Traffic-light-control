# Smart-Traffic-light-control

##  Introduction 

This project was made to manage traffic time dynamicly between two directions in main square by splitting time fairly between the two directions depending on the direction with high flow of cars and vehicles.

The side with the high flow have larger time to grant it's vehicles to pass untill the case change or finished it's time.

We adopted to work purely image processing and not using any kind of AI or Machine Learning stuff and make it so simple,
We used openCV functions and features not adding any third party stuff.
